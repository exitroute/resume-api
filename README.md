# Resume App API

This node.js app was created to support the development of an application 
that would allow a user to perpare and send optimised resumes as part of job 
applications in a few clicks. 

This would allow the user to spend more time networking and less 
time preparing resumes that get only a few seconds of a review.

The idea started as a proposal to turn my resume into a chatbot. After working 
with a static site generator I decide to pause the development of the 
chatbot in favour of developiing an app using **express,** **node,** and 
**mongo,** and implement **CRUD** methods as per the course curriculum.

## Feature List

- users can add contacts and recieve a unique url for that contact
- users receive a report when the recipient of the url lands on the site 
- users can manage the contacts

## Learned 

- about planning and the importance of user stories
- how to deploy using Now from Zeit 
- importance of documentation when leaving a project for several weeks 

## Status

Deployed and enhancements pending.
